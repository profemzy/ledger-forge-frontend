## üìù Documentation Guidelines

### When to Update

**PROJECT_STATUS.md (Daily during sprints):**
- After completing any milestone
- When starting new features
- When test results change
- When metrics update

**Other Documents (As needed):**
- design.md: Major architectural changes
- DATABASE_SETUP.md: Schema changes
- DESIGN_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md: Implementation decisions

### Writing Standards

- Use Markdown for all docs
- Include "Last Updated" date at top
- Use emojis sparingly (‚úÖ ‚≠ê üéØ for highlights only)
- Code examples should be syntax-highlighted
- Link between related documents
- Keep PROJECT_STATUS.md as the primary status source

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Archive

Historical progress documents have been moved to `archive/`:
- PHASE1_COMPLETE.md (Database milestone)
- PHASE1_AUTH_COMPLETE.md (Auth API milestone)
- PHASE1_DATABASE_MILESTONE.md (Database details)
- PROGRESS.md (Old progress tracker)

**All information from these documents is now consolidated in [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md)**

---

## üöÄ Quick Links

**Main Resources:**
- [Project README](../README.md) - Getting started
- [Project Status](PROJECT_STATUS.md) - Current progress ‚≠ê
- [Design Document](../design.md) - Architecture

**API Testing:**
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"SecurePassword123"}'
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Always check PROJECT_STATUS.md first** for current status
2. **Refer to design.md** for architectural context
3. **Use DATABASE_SETUP.md** for database operations
4. **Keep docs in sync** with code changes
5. **Archive old progress docs** - don't delete them
