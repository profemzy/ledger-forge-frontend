## 🚧 In Progress

### Current Sprint: Dashboard & Reporting Polish
**Goal:** Surface richer insights and provide export options

- [ ] Upgrade dashboard charts (net income trend, cash trend)

- [ ] KPI variance vs prior period

- [x] Invoice detail: surface payment applications
- [ ] Overdue invoices quick actions (reminders, mark sent)

### Accounts Payable (Future)
- [ ] Bills & bill payments UI

### Polish
- [ ] Client-side numeric formatting / masking for money & quantities
- [ ] Extract reusable UI primitives (Button, Input, Table, Modal)
- [ ] Light/dark theme tokens & spacing scale review

## 📈 Metrics & Goals

### Performance Targets
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1s
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3s
- [ ] Bundle size < 100KB gzipped
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 95

### Feature Completion
- [x] Project setup (100%)
- [x] Authentication (100%)
- [x] Accounts (100%)
- [x] Transactions (95%)
- [x] Invoices (90%)
- [x] Payments (AR) (90%)
- [x] Reports (85%)
- [ ] Dashboard (70%)

### Code Quality

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Tailwind via CDN is used for speed; consider adding a compile step if needed.
- Numeric inputs are free‑form; add masking/formatting for better UX.
- Some pages show IDs where names could be resolved (minor polish).
