## Metrics

### Code Statistics
- **Total Files:** 18
- **Rust Models:** 9
- **Database Tables:** 15
- **Migrations:** 2
- **Lines of SQL:** ~350
- **Lines of Rust:** ~1,500+

### Quality Checks
- âœ… Compilation: Passing
- âœ… Database migrations: Applied
- âœ… Type safety: Full coverage
- âœ… Validation: Comprehensive

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 Start:** October 3, 2025
- **Database Foundation Complete:** October 3, 2025
- **Estimated Phase 1 Completion:** ~2 weeks
- **Estimated Phase 2 Completion:** ~4 weeks
- **Estimated Total to MVP:** 8-12 weeks

## Key Decisions Log

1. **Edition 2024:** Using latest Rust edition for modern features
2. **Axum over Actix:** Chosen for modern async ecosystem integration
3. **SQLx over Diesel:** Preferred for async-first and flexibility
4. **QuickBooks Compatibility:** Schema designed with migration as priority
5. **UUID Primary Keys:** Chosen for security and distributed systems readiness
6. **rust_decimal:** Selected for financial precision (vs f64)
7. **jsonwebtoken v9:** Using stable version (v10 had compilation issues)

## Notes

- All monetary values use `rust_decimal::Decimal` for precision
- Double-entry validation enforced at both DB and application level
- QuickBooks bridge fields (`quickbooks_id`) nullable for new records
- Multi-tenancy support via `company_id` (optional)
- All timestamps in UTC with automatic triggers
