- [x] Detail with human‑readable accounts, status transitions (Draft→Posted, Posted→Void), and totals

### Invoices
- [x] List with customer/status filters
- [x] Detail with header + line items
- [x] Create with customer selection, dates, memo/addresses, revenue‑account line items, discount %, per‑line and total calculations

### Payments (AR)

## 🚧 In Progress

### Current Sprint: Core UX & Financial Flows
**Goal:** Complete core AR flows and refine UX

- [ ] Global toasts adoption across all actions (partially adopted)
- [ ] Invoice detail: Payments tab and status transitions
- [ ] Payment detail: show existing applications (requires server endpoint)
- [ ] Improve numeric inputs (masks/formatting)

---

## 📋 Upcoming Tasks

### Dashboard & Reporting
- [ ] Dashboard stats (AR, unapplied, overdue, cash)
- [ ] Reporting pages (Trial Balance, P&L, Balance Sheet, AR Aging)

### Accounts Receivable Enhancements
- [ ] Invoice detail: list applied payments (uses /invoices/{id}/payments)
- [ ] Overdue invoices view with quick actions

### Accounts Payable (Future)
- [ ] Bills & bill payments UI

### Polish
- [ ] Client‑side numeric formatting for money and quantities
- [ ] Extract common UI components (Button, Input, Table, Modal)

---

## 📈 Metrics & Goals

### Performance Targets
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1s
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3s
- [ ] Bundle size < 100KB gzipped
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 95

### Feature Completion
- [x] Project setup (100%)
- [x] Authentication (100%)
- [x] Accounts (100%)
- [x] Transactions (90%)
- [x] Invoices (80%)
- [x] Payments (AR) (80%)
- [ ] Dashboard (0%)
- [ ] Reports (0%)

### Code Quality
- [ ] All components tested
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (N/A - using Rust!)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Tailwind via CDN is used for speed; consider adding a compile step if needed.
- Numeric inputs are free‑form; add masking/formatting for better UX.
- Some pages show IDs where names could be resolved (minor polish).
